It's a ZX Spectrum emulator written entirely in Assembler. It runs under MS-DOS, and pretty well also in Windows and MS-DOS emulators, like Dosemu and Dosbox. It's the first emulating the Inves Spectrum + (a Spanish clone)

You can try a newer and better emulator, made also by me, for Unix systems (Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi and others) and Windows here:
